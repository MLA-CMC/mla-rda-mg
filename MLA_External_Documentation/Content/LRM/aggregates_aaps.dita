            <note id="note_qvh_4db_yrb">This is LC-PCC practice as of time of writing; note this is a change from past practice, where typically the preferred title would be recorded as a <term>conventional collective title</term> followed by a period, space, and the term <term>Selections</term> even if the aggregating work is commonly identified by title in manifestations or reference sources. Practice in the Music Division at LC is to retain a CCT/Selections preferred title if there is no collective title or if the preferred title would be genericâ€”that is, it would consist only of a type of composition, number, medium of performance, etc. (e.g., <i>Six guitar preludes</i>; <i>Works for piano 4-hands</i>). </note>

            <title>Expressions created by a single agent, where the creators of the works expressed are unknown or of reduced bibliographic interest</title>
            <p>In some cases where an aggregate features a creator agent of expression common to all the expressions aggregated, the authorized access point for that common creator agent of expression (instead of a common creator agent of work) may be used to qualify the authorized access point for an aggregating work. This option may be applied under the following conditions:</p>

                                <li>An album in which the name of the featured performer, ensemble, etc., is emphasized and the creators of the works aggregated are significantly downplayed or wholly omitted</li>

                                        not necessarily indicative of an attempt to faithfully
