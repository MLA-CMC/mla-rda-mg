        <p>The Library Reference Model<fn><ph conkeyref="bped_boilerplate/p_ikd_tym_vrb"/></fn> introduced the concept of the <term>representative expression attribute</term>, from which RDA's representative expression elements are derived.<lq id="lq_enr_bym_vrb"><b>Definition:</b> An attribute which is deemed essential in characterizing the <term>work</term> and whose values are taken from a representative or canonical <term>expression</term> of the <term>work</term>.</lq><lq id="lq_hrs_mwm_vrb"><b>Scope notes:</b> ...The values of these attributes are inferred either from particular <term>expressions</term> considered to best represent the <term>work</term>, or from characteristics abstracted from a more or less nebulous network of
                similar <term>expressions</term>. There is no requirement to precisely identify an <term>expression</term> or <term>expressions</term> which serves as source for the values of the <term>representative expression attributes</term>, nor does that <term>expression</term> need to be recorded in the case where it is identified.</lq></p>
        <p>For much of Western art music, which tends to focus attention on the work and its creator(s), the notion of declaring any particular expression a <term>representative expression</term> is fraught. In this context, representative expressions are best thought of, and less problematic, if viewed through the "nebulous network of similar expressions" model; any expression may be considered representative so long as it shares essential characteristics (representative expression elements) common to many "original or canonical realization[s] of a work," as RDA puts it. RDA does not require that a representative expression exist to be treated as representative; in other words, it may represent a hypothetical ideal.</p>
        <p>However, much modern popular music evolved and spread in tandem with recording technology, to the extent that often specific recorded performances (usually the first issued) are considered "definitive" in ways that recordings of art music generally are not. It is much easier to consider a particular performance of a popular song or a particular aggregation of performances in an album to be "an original or canonical realization of a work."</p>
        <p>For music that does not fit cleanly into or clearly parallel either category, cataloger's judgment is required. In general, consider how definitive a given expression could or would be in the context of that particular musical tradition and whether users are more likely to approach the <term>find</term> and <term>identify</term> LRM user tasks at the work or expression level.</p>
