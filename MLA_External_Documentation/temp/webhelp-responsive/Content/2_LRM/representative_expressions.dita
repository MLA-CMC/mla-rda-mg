In this context, representative expressions are best thought of, and less problematic, if viewed through the "nebulous network of similar expressions" model; any expression may be considered representative so long as it shares essential characteristics (representative expression elements) common to many "original or canonical realization[s] of a work," as RDA puts it. RDA does not require that a representative expression exist to be treated as representative; in other words, it may represent a hypothetical ideal.</p>
