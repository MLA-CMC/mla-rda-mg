    <title>Original Print-on-Demand Publications</title>
    <body>
        <p>Some publishers make scores available for purchase exclusively as print-on-demand material, either as one division or imprint of the publisher or as a sole business model. These publications do not fit the criteria of print-on-demand reproductions as set out in LC-PCC documentation, but present many of the same challenges and questions for cataloging. Guidance for these types of publications will be included at a later date.</p>
