Some labels may correspond exactly to a corporate body or operate as divisions or subsidiaries of a corporate body. However, labels do not necessarily share a one-to-one relationship with the entities that own and manage them. For example, the Columbia label—the oldest sound recording label still active—has been owned by at least seven companies in its history, three of which have been divisions of Sony. </p>
            <p class="- topic/p " xtrf="file:/C:/Users/kek67197/OneDrive%20-%20University%20of%20Georgia/Work%20From%20Home/CSS/MLA%20RDA%20MG/MLA_External_Documentation/Content/4_Description/Formats/formats_sound_recordings_labels.dita" xtrc="p:3;10:16">As a further complication, the publisher or label is frequently distinct from the entity or entities that hold the copyright or other rights to the music presented on the recording. This is most obvious when one company or label is identified as having licensed the music to another company or label for publication, but it can occur in less obvious ways as well. For example, the company Bella Musica Edition administers three labels: Antes Edition, Bella Musica, and Thorofon; for all three, the copyright holder named on the recording is the parent company, Bella Musica Edition.</p>
